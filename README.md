Some of these notes are old, and only suitable for rapid prototyping.

For more recent notes (which include the good parts of these), see my [cheat sheets repository](https://github.com/jfhector/cheat-sheets/tree/master/tech-notes/react)

<hr/>

My own notes and real code examples from working prototypes to establish and document optimal patterns for rapid prototyping with React and Typescript.

See [proto](https://github.com/jfhector/proto), my React rapid prototyping boilerplate, for accompanying example.
